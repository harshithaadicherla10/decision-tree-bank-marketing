# 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier – Bank Marketing Dataset

This project builds a **Decision Tree Classifier** using the **Bank Marketing Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and behavioral data.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- Data preprocessing and label encoding of categorical features
- Binary classification using **DecisionTreeClassifier** from `sklearn`
- Model evaluation with **accuracy score**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**
- Visual representation of the decision tree

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Visuals
